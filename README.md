# CheapMC

**CheapMC** is a Minecraft resource pack that represents the game in a deliberately cheap and low-quality visual style. The project is inspired by low-cost online shops that often deliver products with poor quality and inconsistent appearance.



This is the **official** [**GitHub Repository**](https://github.com/deutschich/CheapMC). Feel free to contribute to the project with creating own textures and add them with a [Pull Request on the official GitHub](https://github.com/deutschich/CheapMC/pulls) to add them to the **Official Pack**! (Please pull into the `dev` Branch and **not** into the `main` Branch)

## Design Philosophy

The goal of CheapMC is to reinterpret selected Minecraft textures with a cheap, imperfect, and mass-produced aesthetic. The resource pack does not aim to fully replace Minecraft’s original visual identity, but instead modifies individual elements step by step.

All textures included in this resource pack are **hand-pixelled** and created manually.

## Updates

CheapMC is an **actively developed** project. The resource pack will receive regular updates, adding new textures and adjusting existing ones as development continues.
